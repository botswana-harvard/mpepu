this project should be at ~/bhp056

cd ~/
svn co http://192.168.1.50/svn/bhp056_project bhp056

you now need to get the "mpepu" application from subversion. 

cd ~/bhp056
svn co http://192.168.1.50/svn/mpepu mpepu

After that read the README file in the "mpepu" folder where you
will find the other applications that "mpepu" needs.

quit;

run syncdb again (as above)
